# Quantum Programming

**under construction**

Quantum computers perform their calculations by executing quantum operations,
but these are encoded with classic bits and bytes.

So far the only quantum device in a quantum computer is the quantum processor.
The control system reads the classic bits and bytes of the quantum instructions.

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

There are several quantum SDKs and the [Unitary Foundation](https://unitary.foundation/) covered this in several [Quantum Open Source Surveys](https://unitaryfoundation.github.io/survey-2025/).
Among others the 2025 survey lists these [full-stack development platforms](https://unitaryfoundation.github.io/survey-2025/#full-stack-development-platforms-compilers-and-simulators-used-currently-or-in-the-future).
