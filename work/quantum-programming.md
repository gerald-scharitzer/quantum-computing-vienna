# Quantum Programming

**under construction**

Quantum computers perform their calculations by executing quantum operations,
but these are encoded with classic bits and bytes.

So far the only quantum device in a quantum computer is the quantum processor.
The control system reads the classic bits and bytes of the quantum instructions.

## Software Development Kit (SDK)

There are several quantum SDKs.
